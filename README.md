# RandomStringMatcher

RandomStringMatcher is a simple C# console application that generates random strings of the same length as a given text. The application continuously generates random strings until it finds one that matches the given text exactly. It then outputs the number of attempts and the time taken to find the match.

## Features

- Generates random strings using a predefined set of characters (letters, digits, and spaces).
- Measures the time taken to find the matching string.
- Counts the number of attempts required to find the matching string.
